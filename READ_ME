This program is the original work of Kaleb Kircher (https://github.com/KalebKE/FFT_Java)

The program performs a Fast Fourier Transform on an input .dat file

Sample length can be modified as a constant to experiment with differing amounts of samples,
but must be a power of 2.  


Project was implemented and modified to use a scanner to read from a .dat file; rather than a 
hard-coded signal, as the program originally featured.  

Dependancies
jmathio - for complex calculations
jmathplot - to graph the resulting k[n]

Results show similar frequency spectrums to the results produced by analyzing the same signal
in a widely used program such as Audacity.  
Optimal amount of samples to input (SL - sample length) appears to be 4096.
